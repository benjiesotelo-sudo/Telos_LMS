# Telos_LMS — Continue Here

Multi-instructor learning-management system (the "Telos" brand). This is the at-a-glance handoff so any new session picks up fast.

## Status (2026-06-26): Slice 1 LIVE + Theme B built on `feat/theme-b-classes-roster` (awaiting merge)
- **Deployed:** https://telos-lms.vercel.app  (Vercel — auto-deploys on push to `main`).
- **Backend:** Supabase cloud project `dprrunxkmsavqmbuzkwf`.  (NEVER touch the old `SOTELO_GradeBook` project `lvcdlulyvwbjrwvkmfwt`.)
- **Instructor login:** benjiesotelo@gmail.com.  Pilot class: AMS0011, period **Midyear**.
- **Tests:** `npm test` → **98/98** (on the Theme B branch).  Production `npm run build` passes.
- **What works (Slice 1):** instructor imports a JSON assessment → assigns it to a class → enrolls a student (copy-paste invite link) → student logs in, takes it, it auto-grades against a server-only answer key, both see the score. Email/password auth, RLS tenant isolation, client-side localStorage auto-save, single-submission integrity, FEU green/gold design.

### Theme B — Classes/Sections + Batch Roster (branch `feat/theme-b-classes-roster`, reviewed, ready to merge)
- **Model:** reusable **Courses** (code/title/description) → **Classes/sections** (course + period + section_label + PIC, shown `AMS0011 - 6A`) that enrollments + assignments now point to. `periods`/`invites` tables dropped; class-based RLS helpers; pilot AMS0011·Midyear backfilled into a class.
- **New flow:** instructor creates a course + class → generates an **enroll link** (class-join 7d / general 2d, on-demand, live countdown) → student self-registers at **`/register/[token]`** (name/student#/email/password; role forced `student`, `status=pending`) → lands in the instructor's **pending list** → instructor **approves/rejects**. Duplicate guard on email + student number. Migrations `0003`–`0005`.
- **DEPLOY TODO (cloud):** schedule `select public.purge_expired_pending();` via pg_cron (or a manual SQL-Editor sweep) to purge >7-day-stale pending accounts. Function is `revoke`d from anon/authenticated — service-role/SQL-Editor only.
- **Deferred follow-ups (non-blocking, from final review):** at approval, add a section-picker in PendingPanel for general-link registrants who joined with no section (currently they activate with no enrollment); add a DB unique index on `profiles.student_number`; tidy swallowed `profiles`-query errors in the actions; scope a couple of remaining cosmetic items (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-telos-theme-b-classes-roster-design.md` + the SDD ledger `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`).

## Run it locally
Prereqs: **Docker Desktop running** + the **Supabase CLI** (`brew install supabase/tap/supabase`).
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Telos_LMS
supabase start     # boots the local stack (first run pulls images, slow)
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm test           # 74/74 — vitest runs against the LOCAL stack only
```
Tests run against the LOCAL Supabase stack (globalSetup asserts the URL is 127.0.0.1, so they can never hit the cloud). `.env.local` holds the cloud URL + keys for the dev server; the service-role key is secret + gitignored.

## Deploy
Push to `main` → Vercel rebuilds + redeploys automatically. Cloud DB migrations: `supabase link --project-ref dprrunxkmsavqmbuzkwf` then `supabase db push`. `seed.sql` is run manually in the Supabase SQL Editor — it bootstraps the instructor (looked up by email) + the pilot course/period.

### One-time cloud SQL steps (run in Supabase SQL Editor AFTER `supabase db push` of migrations 0006 + 0007)

> **Prerequisites:** migrations 0003–0007 must be applied (`supabase db push`). If earlier migrations (0003–0005) were already pushed, only 0006 and 0007 are needed.

**Benjie (super-admin)** — skip if you already ran `seed.sql` in the SQL Editor (it does this automatically):
```sql
update public.profiles p
   set role           = 'admin',
       status         = 'active',
       prefix         = '',
       first_name     = 'Benjamin',
       middle_initial = 'C.',
       last_name      = 'Sotelo',
       suffix         = '',
       student_number = '202601011',
       full_name      = 'Benjamin C. Sotelo'
  from auth.users u
 where u.email = 'benjiesotelo@gmail.com'
   and p.id = u.id;
```

**Mamoun (student)** — fill in `<mamoun_email>` before running (do not hardcode student email in the repo):
```sql
update public.profiles p
   set first_name     = 'Mamoun',
       middle_initial = 'F R',
       last_name      = 'Bani',
       prefix         = '',
       suffix         = '',
       student_number = '2024046681',
       full_name      = 'Mamoun F R Bani'
  from auth.users u
 where u.email = '<mamoun_email>'
   and p.id = u.id;
```
Replace `<mamoun_email>` with Mamoun's actual login email before executing.

## Full history lives in the AIS-OS repo (mission control)
- Plan: `~/Documents/AIS-OS/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-25-telos-lms-slice-1.md`
- Spec: `~/Documents/AIS-OS/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-25-telos-lms-design.md`
- Decisions + backlog: `~/Documents/AIS-OS/decisions/log.md` (2026-06-25 / 2026-06-26 entries)

## Architecture must-knows (do NOT regress)
- **Answer key never reaches the client.** Keys live in `assessment_keys` (RLS on, ZERO policies → service-role only). The take page serves only `assessments.questions`. `importAssessment` whitelist-rebuilds questions so no answer field is ever stored.
- **Tenant isolation** is RLS-enforced via a denormalized `instructor_id` (flat policies) + SECURITY DEFINER helpers; proven by `tests/rls.test.ts` with per-user clients.
- **Grading** (`lib/grading.ts`) is a verbatim port of the FEU `grading.html` / `verify_assessments.py` logic — `norm()` + pooled-by-points + bonus-excluded-from-possible; parity locked in `tests/grading.test.ts`. The import JSON is generated by `~/Documents/AIS-OS/projects/Telos_AMS0011/build/build_assessments.py` (`write_assessment_json`).
- **Privilege-escalation guard:** `0002_rls.sql` revokes table UPDATE on `profiles` and re-grants only `(full_name, student_number)` — a student can't self-promote to admin. Never re-grant table-level UPDATE on `profiles`.
- `createClient()` is **async** — always `await` it. The test-auth seam returns a per-user anon client under VITEST, never the service-role client.

## Slice 2 backlog (next)
**Full agenda + build order:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-telos-slice-2-roadmap.md`
Build order: **B (classes+roster) → A (profiles/roles) → C (instructor) → D (student) →** E hardening.
- **Theme B (START HERE):** real classes (course code + title/description, multi-course), per-class period/PIC, batch enrollment via invite link with student self-fill
- **Theme A:** profile view + logout (both roles), student detail-change requests, self-promote to super admin
- **Theme C:** instructor dashboard (assessments by type), manage/preview quiz + view correct answers, quiz name/description, quiz timer setting, fast assign-to-class
- **Theme D:** student dashboard, view classes, view class details (deadlines/timers), pre-quiz screen, live countdown + auto-submit
- **Theme E (woven in):** server-side auto-save + cross-device resume; status enforcement; transactional `importAssessment`; BEFORE-UPDATE role trigger on `profiles`; duplicate-invite guard; `middleware`→`proxy` rename; N+1 student-dashboard query; saved Supabase admin SQL (`List Users`, `Clean Test Data`, `Health Check`, `1st Setup`)
- Also pending: weighted **gradebook** + CSV export

## To continue
`cd ~/Documents/Telos_LMS`, start a Claude session here, say "continue the Telos_LMS build."

## 2026-06-27 — Slice 2 build on branch `feat/theme-n-app-shell` (verified; cloud migrated to 0010; NOT merged to main)
Large autonomous build. Branch ~45 commits beyond main. Verified: **231 tests green, build clean, headless e2e 12/12**. Cloud DB migrated through **0010** (all additive). **Production (main) still = Theme B era** until merged.

### Built on the branch (each task two-stage reviewed + tested)
- **Theme N — App Shell:** left-sidebar nav (instructor + student), routed pages, enroll-link management (list active / reuse / revoke / live countdown), no-refresh via server-side `refresh()` from `next/cache`.
- **Theme A — Identity:** structured names (prefix/first/MI/last/suffix → auto `full_name`); registration collects them; profile view/edit; **change-password** (`/account/password`) + **reset-recovery** (`/reset-password`) pages + login "Forgot password"; **super-admin (`admin`) account management** (`/instructor/users`: CRUD users + reset password; last-admin/self-demotion lockout guard). Seed makes Benjie super-admin `Benjamin C. Sotelo`; Mamoun cloud-update documented.
- **Theme C — Course hub + FEU gradebook:** two-level **Courses & Classes** (course → sections → class detail); class detail (contents + enrolled students + editable **period/section** + **weights**); per-assignment **period(Midterm/Final)/active/reveal** toggles + deadlines; **FEU grade sheet by section** (model: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-feu-gradebook-model.md`); **manual score override = raw score / total_points → %** (bonus may exceed 100); instructor **preview + view answers** (key stays server-side); **student answer reveal** only when enabled+closed+graded.
- **Manual assessments:** `is_manual` assessments (name+type+points, NOT takeable online); created on Assessments page (block under Import); assigned via an **assessment dropdown** (pick by name, no IDs); graded in the sheet (raw score).
- **e2e harness:** `e2e/seed.mjs` + `e2e/smoke.mjs` (Playwright). To run: `supabase db reset` → `node e2e/seed.mjs` → start a LOCAL-pointed dev server on :3100 (inline NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321 + local anon/service keys + PORT=3100) → `node e2e/smoke.mjs`. Logs in as `e2e-admin@local.test` / `E2e_admin_pass123!`, loads every page, flags loops/console/page errors/stuck-loading.

### Migrations (cloud now at 0010): 0006 name fields · 0007 trigger copies names · 0008 assignment period/active/reveal + class weights · 0009 grade_overrides · 0010 is_manual.

### LEFT TO DO
1. **Merge branch → `main`** to ship everything to production (cloud already migrated to 0010). Pattern: `git checkout main && git merge feat/theme-n-app-shell`, run `npm test` on merged main, `git push origin main` (Vercel auto-deploys), delete branch.
2. **User's final check** pending: assign a manual assessment (dropdown) + enter a raw grade in the sheet.
3. **Theme D** (student experience: real dashboards, view classes/details, pre-quiz screen, live quiz timer + auto-submit) — NOT started.
4. **Theme E / deferred follow-ups:** `handle_new_user` trigger still trusts metadata `role` → ensure cloud signups OFF or force role=student; section-picker for unplaced general-link registrants at approval; `student_number` DB unique index; schedule `purge_expired_pending()` via pg_cron; `middleware`→`proxy` rename; misc review minors logged in `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`.

### DEV-MODE GOTCHA (not a bug): long-running `next dev` + an open tab loops repeated GETs after many hot-reloads (esp. while files are being edited). e2e on a fresh browser = 0 loops; production (built app) unaffected. Fix: restart `npm run dev` + hard-reload (Cmd+Shift+R).

### AGENTS.md rules added this session: (1) no frozen-looking screens (loading.tsx + pending buttons); (2) `'use server'` files may export ONLY async actions — never a const/array (a client import of such a const crashes at runtime while the build still passes).

### NEXT-SESSION feature: split the Grades view into two tables (requested 2026-06-27)
- **Top = Grade Sheet (read-only):** the existing FEU computed table (category %s → MG/FG → Course MARK + LG). The submit-report; remove inline editing from it.
- **Bottom = Grade Editor (editable):** a separate table, rows = students, columns = each assessment, each cell shows **raw score / max points** (e.g. `85 / 100`) and is editable. Editing sets the grade_override (raw, out of `total_points`); it flows up into the top sheet (server `refresh()`). Online auto-graded items show their auto score/possible; manual items show the entered score/total_points.
- Files: `app/instructor/grades/GradeSheet.tsx` (split into a read-only sheet + a `GradeEditor` component), `app/instructor/grades/page.tsx`. Data already in `getSectionGrades` (`cells` %, `rawOverrides`, `totalPoints` per assessment).
- **Perf:** `getSectionGrades` does ~5 sequential cloud queries — parallelize with `Promise.all` to speed up the grades page. (Dev-mode + cloud latency is the main slowness; production/Vercel is much faster.)

## ▶▶ FIRST TASK WHEN RESUMING (user directive 2026-06-27): build the **grade editor** (the two-table Grades split described in "NEXT-SESSION feature" above) BEFORE anything else. Then Theme D / hardening.
